  <summary>stuff with *mark* **down** in `summary` doesn't work any more, use HTML <i>italics</i> and <b>bold</b> instead in <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> (<i>click to expand</i>)</summary>
  <!-- have to be followed by an empty line! -->

## *formatted* **heading** with [a](link)
```java
code block
```

  <details>
    <summary><u>nested</u> <b>stuff</b> (<i>click to expand</i>)</summary>
    <!-- have to be followed by an empty line! -->

A bit more than normal indentation is necessary to get the nesting correct,
 1. list
 1. with
    1. nested
    1. items
        ```java
        // including code
        ```
    1. blocks
 1. and continued non-nested
