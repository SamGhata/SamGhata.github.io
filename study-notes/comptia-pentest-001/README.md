# CompTIA PenTest+: PT0-001

These notes follow a [study outline](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest) that was created for an EasyClass experiment during October through December 2021. The [exam](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest#examdetails) was in transition from version 001 to 002 during this period, but no updated study materials were yet available.
