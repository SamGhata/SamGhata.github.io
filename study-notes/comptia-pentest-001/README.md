# CompTIA PenTest+: PT0-001

These notes follow a [study outline](https://github.com/SamGhata/SamGhata.github.io/blob/main/study-plans/comptia-pentest-001.md) that was created for an EasyClass experiment during October through December 2021. The [exam](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest#examdetails) is in transition from version 001 to 002 during this period, but no updated study materials are yet available.

### Day 2
**What Is Penetration Testing?**  
attacker's main skill is using available tools, applying custom edits as needed, then using them to synthesize information provided and pinpoint potential weaknesses - penetration testing mimics this process to identify and correct issues  
  
*CIA triad* - model to descrive the goals of information security  
Confidentiality - prevent unauthorized access  
Integrity - prevent unauthorized modificaton  
Availability - ensure legitimate use  
  
*DAD triad* - attacker's goals  
Disclosure attacks gain unauthorized access  
Alteration attacks make unauthorized changes  
Denial attacks prevent legitimate use  

hacker mindset - finding one vital flaw that defeats the entire security system, only need to "win" once of many attempts to be successful  
Cybersecurity professionals must "win" 100% to be successful  
  
**Reasons for Penetration Testing**  
"penetration testing provides us with visibility into 
the organization’s security posture that simply isn’t available by other means"  
  
SOC - Security Operation Center, monitoring station for IDS alerts etc  
  
threat hunting - use the attacker mindset to search infrastructure for artifacts of successful attack, philosophy of "presumption of compromise"  
  
compliance testing - cybersecurity required as a matter of law or regulation  
PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, regulation that governs all organizations involved in the storage, processsing, or transmission of credit and debit card transactions, must complete thorough pentesting of all systems    
CDE - Cardholder Data Environment  
PCI DSS brief [goals](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security) and document [library](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library)  
  
[NIST SP 800-115](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/nist-sp-800-115)  
NIST Special Publication 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment ([PDF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf))  
  
[Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance](www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1.pdf)  

**Who Performs Penetration Tests?**  
internal vs external penetration testing teams  
  
internal - current employees, testing full time or on schedule, have contextual knowledge of organization, less expensive, may have unconscious bias (fail to imagine/test issue), could be difficult to spot flaws if they contributed to the work, may lack independence    
  
external - typically consulting firm, highly skileed (all the do, all day), independent, less bias or "overlooking", may have conflict of intrest if working for competitor etc, shouldn't be responsible for designing AND testing the system  
  
scheduled, repeted testing needed - due to system changes, new exploits, different personell may have different methodology or skills and find new issues, consider rotating specific work among team members if possible  

### Day 3
**The CompTIA Penetration Testing Process**  
*CompTIA model for penetration testing stages*  
Planning and Scoping  
Information Gathering and Vulnerability Identification  
Attacking and Exploiting  
Reporting and Communicating Results  

the difference between hacking and penetration testing is *permission and agreement* on the activities (planning and scoping)  

(note - PenTest+ supplies about 1/3 of material content also used in the CySA+ exam)
 

**The Cyber Kill Chain**  
pioneered by [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) in [2011](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) - guide available *Applying Cyber Kill Chain® Methodology* ([PDF](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf))  

7 step outline:  
*Reconnaissance* - OSINT and initial scans  
*Weaponization* - uses info discovered to craft a specific attack tool  
*Delivery* - via network/app exploit, social engineering, USB drop, email, or other  
*Exploitation* - payload triggered and access/foothold achieved  
*Installation* - foothold converted to persistance via system backdoor, credential theft or new user, installed web shell, etc  
*Command & Control* - remote access of compromised system  
*Actions on Objectives* - the "end goal" such as exfiltration, DoS, further intrustion, etc  

Reconnaissance falls in Information Gathering for the CompTIA model, with all the rest in Attacking and Exploiting  

additional reading - there is another popular model called [MITRE ATT&CK® framework](https://attack.mitre.org/), brief [comparison](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/how-to-use-the-mitre-attck-framework-and-the-lockheed-martin-cyber-kill-chain-together/)  
 
**Tools of the Trade**  
the CompTIA [exam objectives](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-pentest-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf) list 50 tools to be familar with knowing use-case and operation (page 11, [screencap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamGhata/SamGhata.github.io/dev/study-notes/comptia-pentest-001/image/comptia-pentest-tools.png))  
"be able to describe the purpose of each of these tools in a coherent sentence"

Nmap flags (by Am):  
```
Nmap Command-Line Parameters

You are expected to be familiar with Nmap and some of the different Nmap switches for the CompTIA PenTest+ certification exam. Following are the Nmap switches to be familiar with:

    -sP: Used to do a ping sweep with Nmap.
    -sS: Used to perform a SYN scan that does not establish a full connection with the port.
    -sT: Used to perform a TCP connect scan.
    -p: Used to specify the ports to be scanned.
    -sV: Used to return the version of the software a port is associated with.
    -O: Used to perform an operating system (OS) fingerprint to identify the OS of a system.
    -Pn: Used to disable pings.
    -T0: A paranoid scan used to try to avoid an intrusion detection system (IDS) by increasing the time between scan packets delivered. This is the slowest of scans.
    -T4: An aggressive scan that increases the speed of the scan and assumes you have the bandwidth to do so. Use this scan if you are not worried about detection.
