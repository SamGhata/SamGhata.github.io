# CompTIA PenTest+: PT0-001

These notes follow a [study outline](https://github.com/SamGhata/SamGhata.github.io/blob/main/study-plans/comptia-pentest-001.md) that was created for an EasyClass experiment during October through December 2021. The [exam](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest#examdetails) is in transition from version 001 to 002 during this period, but no updated study materials are yet available.

### Day 2
**What Is Penetration Testing?**  
attacker's main skill is using available tools, applying custom edits as needed, then using them to synthesize information provided and pinpoint potential weaknesses - penetration testing mimics this process to identify and correct issues  
  
*CIA triad* - model to descrive the goals of information security  
Confidentiality - prevent unauthorized access  
Integrity - prevent unauthorized modificaton  
Availability - ensure legitimate use  
  
*DAD triad* - attacker's goals  
Disclosure attacks gain unauthorized access  
Alteration attacks make unauthorized changes  
Denial attacks prevent legitimate use  

hacker mindset - finding one vital flaw that defeats the entire security system, only need to "win" once of many attempts to be successful  
Cybersecurity professionals must "win" 100% to be successful  
  
**Reasons for Penetration Testing**  
"penetration testing provides us with visibility into 
the organization’s security posture that simply isn’t available by other means"  
  
SOC - Security Operation Center, monitoring station for IDS alerts etc  
  
threat hunting - use the attacker mindset to search infrastructure for artifacts of successful attack, philosophy of "presumption of compromise"  
  
compliance testing - cybersecurity required as a matter of law or regulation  
PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, regulation that governs all organizations involved in the storage, processsing, or transmission of credit and debit card transactions, must complete thorough pentesting of all systems    
CDE - Cardholder Data Environment  
PCI DSS brief [goals](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security) and document [library](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library)
