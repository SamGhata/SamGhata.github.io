## Activity 1.1: Adopting the Hacker Mind-Set
*Before we dive into the many technical examples throughout this book, let’s try an example of applying the hacker mind-set to everyday life. Think about the grocery store where you normally shop. What are some of the security measures used by that store to prevent the theft of cash and merchandise? What ways can you think of to defeat those controls?*  

The entrance vestibule is a possible mantrap. It's glass and could be defeated with a smash, if prepared.  
The store uses a video survelence system that could be disable at the source, likely in the office.  
The store is often very busy during peak hours, and merchandise theft could be easier than other times of day. 

## Activity 1.2: Using the Cyber Kill Chain
*Choose a real-world example of a cybersecurity incident from recent news. Select an example in which there is a reasonable amount of technical detail publicly available. Describe this attack in terms of the Cyber Kill Chain. How did the attacker carry out each step of the process? Were any steps skipped? If there is not enough information available to definitively address an element of the Cyber Kill Chain, offer some assumptions about what may have happened.*  

The 2019 attack against the government of Jackson County, Georgia was investigated. Several familar incidents were initially considered, but found to commonly have few technical details about the incident. Jackson County Manager Kevin Poe identified¹ the software used as "Ryuk," and information² about this malware strain³ was used to answer most of this activity.
