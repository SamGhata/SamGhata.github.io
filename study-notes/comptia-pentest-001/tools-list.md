This is a hyperlinked list of tools to be familar with for the CompTIA PenTest+: PT0-001 exam. The list is taken from the [exam objectives](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-pentest-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf) (page 11) and the popular Sybex preparation guide recommends to "be able to describe the purpose of each of these tools in a coherent sentence." Many (most?) of these tools are natively available in [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/tools/) and should be checked before looking to do specific installation.
