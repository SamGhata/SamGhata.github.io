VMware is advised for the virtual machine (VM) hosting, as it is the hypervisor supported by Offensive Security if any issues are encountered. It is not a requirement, but [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) is often used by OSCP students.<br>

The simplest way to get Kali running is to check the [Kali Linux downloads](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) page for the link to their prepared [Kali VMware images](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/). The image is packed with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), which will also need installed. Choose a location for the VM files and right-click on the downloaded image, then choose 7-Zip > Extract Here. After the VM files are unpacked, launch VMware Workstation and at the main menu choose "Open a Virtual Machine". Navigate to the folder where the files were unpacked, and select the .vmx file.
